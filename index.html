                <h2>About</h2>
                <p>My Name is Alan Ward. I'm a Computer Science student at Ontario Tech Univeristy. 
                The purpose of making this website was to display my projects and information to potential employers, 
                aswell as improving my Web Dev skills. As a child, I was always interested in building things and solving prolems.
                I had an interest in math and science and was always curious about how computers worked. Near the end of elementary school, 
                I started learning about programing and found the website Scratch that let me create my own games. I became hooked. 
                Throughout highschool I explored programing languages like Javascript and HTML and especially python.
                I would spend hours after school making games with python. Now as a computer science student, 
                I have the privalaged to learn many fasinating aspects of computer science and hopfully one day have a 
                career in the tech industy. Some areas of computer science I am particularally intersted in are; WebDev,
                Computer Arcitecture/Embedded Systems, and Data Science, aswell as project development as a whole. 
                I am constantly trying to learn new skills and technologies, and I try to futher my knowledge by creating interesting 
                and inivative projects. As you futher explore my website, I have examples of many of the projects I have made, 
                in and out of school.

                <div id="Gomoku Website/Chat Server">
                    <H3>Gomoku game server</H3>
                    <p>While taking "Software Development and Integreation, part of the curiculem was to create 3 group projects. The first was a spam detection program that will be shown later in the website. The second was a chat server, but It was integrated into the final project so I have not included it. The final project was a server that allowed you to host a japanease game similar the checkers. 
                        The server used websokets for bidirectional communication, and was created with JS/HTML/CSS for the frontend, and Java for the backend. As mentioned, Each game had an independed chat room where opponents and spectators could communitcate in real time.
                        The project taught me a lot about websokets and web development. It also forced me to improve my design, documentation, and commenting skills for better readability and look.
                        It was a very enjoyable project to make Inspired me to create a checkers website. I didn't like that the Gomoku server was only able to be locally hosted so I tried to created website (somewhat similar to the project) that allowed users to play checkers against eachother while being hosted on the web.

                <div id="Spam Detection">
                    <H3>Spam Detection Program</H3>
                    <p>As mentioned in the project above, my Software Development and Integreation course required me to make a spam detection program. We were given a data set of emails that were labeled spam or ham(not spam). Using a metioned involing finding the probability of certain word found in alot of spam emailing and putting it in a hashmap, we were able to detect spam emails with a 89% accuracy.
                        The project used Java in the backend and JS/HTML/CSS for the frontend display. The project taught me a lot about data reading, as it gave me the freedom to find inovative solutions for detecting spam. 
                        It was alot of fun working on the project and I'd like to explore popular technics for spam detection.

                <div id="Sudoku Solver">
                    <H3>Sudoku Solver</H3>
                    <p>This was a project I started in grade 11, but didn't have the proper knowledge to complete untill the end of my first universtiy semester. I tried many different technics of solving a given sudoku matrix using interation, but I wasn't able to complete it until I learned recursion in my intro cs course. I was able to use recurcive backtracking to attempt thousands of solutions for the board, going back one step every time there was an illegal move, until the board was solved. 
                        This project really pushed my coding skills and required me to try many methods over 2 years, but I am very glad I did it and I taught me so much.

                <div id="ChatGPT games"></div>
                <h3>Multiple games made with help from ChatGPT 3</h3>
                <p>When ChaptGPT 3 was first released, I was very curious to see how good it was at coding and how I would be able to use it to increase my productivity. unfortunately it wasn't very good at that time but it still allowed me to make some simple games quickier that I would have without it.
                    I made flappybird, minesweeper, and snake, each in only a couple hours. I was fun to explore the new technology and since then AI has improved alot so I might revisite the project in the future or add some more simple games</p>
